* Welcome to My First Post!

This is the first entry on my terminal website, written in Org Mode.
This file can be read using the 'cat blog/first-post' command.

** Sub-heading: What We've Done

Key milestones in this project so far:
  - Core terminal infrastructure (command manager)
  - A virtual file system (VFS)
  - Cool commands like 'ls', 'cd', 'cat', 'theme', and 'neofetch'

*** Another Sub-heading

We can even show code blocks (which 'cat' will format later):

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  console.log("Hello, Org Mode!");
#+END_SRC

More to come...
